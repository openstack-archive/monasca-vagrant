Installs a mini monitoring environment based on Vagrant. Intended for development of the monitoring infrastructure.

# Installation

## Get the Code

```
git clone https://github.com/stackforge/monasca-vagrant
```
## Install Vagrant

### Install VirtualBox and Vagrant
Note: Vagrant version 1.5.0 or higher is required.

#### MacOS
The following steps assume you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed.  Otherwise, install [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) manually from their websites, then continue with Set Up Berkshelf below.

```
brew tap phinze/cask
brew install brew-cask
brew cask install virtualbox 
brew cask install vagrant
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu)
```
# For Ubuntu 12.04, you may need to install ruby 1.9 first
sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3
sudo update-alternatives --set ruby /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1

sudo apt-get install virtualbox
latest=`curl -s http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html |tr " " "\n" |grep 'x86_64.deb' |cut -d'"' -f2`
wget $latest && sudo dpkg -i `basename $latest`
```

### Set Up Berkshelf
#### MacOS
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf --plugin-version '>= 2.0.1'
gem install berkshelf
```
#### Linux (Ubuntu)
```
sudo vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf --plugin-version '>= 2.0.1'
sudo gem install berkshelf
```

# Using mini-mon

- Your host OS home dir is synced to `/vagrant_home` on the VM.
- The root dir of the monasca-vagrant repo on your host OS is synced to `/vagrant` on the VM.
- The main VM will have an IP of 192.168.10.4 that can be access from other services running on the host.
- An additional VM running DevStack will be created at 192.168.10.5
- You can access UI by navigating to http://192.168.10.5 and logging in as mini-mon with password
- Run `vagrant ssh <host>` to log in, where `<host>` is either `mini-mon` or `devstack`
- Run `vagrant help` for more info

## Internal Endpoints
- Influxdb is available at http://192.168.10.4:8083 with root/root as user/password
- The Monasa-api is available at http://192.168.10.4:8080
- The keystone credentials used are mini-mon/password in the mini-mon project. The keystone services in 192.168.10.5 on standard ports.

## Updating
When someone updates the config, this process should allow you to bring up an updated VM.

- `git pull`
- `berks update`
- `vagrant box update`
- `vagrant destroy <vm>` Where `<vm>` is the name of the VM being updated, for example 'vertica'
- `vagrant up`

## Improving Provisioning Speed

The slowest part of the provisioning process is the downloading of deb packages.

### Local cache

To speed this up a local apt-cacher-ng can be used.

#### Linux (Ubuntu)
```
sudo apt-get install apt-cacher-ng
```
#### MacOS
```
brew install apt-cacher-ng
```
Run `apt-cacher-ng -c /usr/local/etc/apt-cacher-ng/` or optionally follow the instructions from brew to start up the cache automatically.
That is all that is needed.  From now on, the cache will be used.

A report from the cache is found at http://localhost:3142/acng-report.html

### vagrant-cachier

Instead of using apt-cacher-ng you can also use the Vagrant plugin
`vagrant-cachier` available at https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier. To
use it with this Vagrant box you simply have to install the plugin.

```
sudo vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
```

## Cookbook Development

To develop cookbook changes with Vagrant:

- Edit Berksfile, changing the appropriate cookbook line to a local path.  For example:
```
cookbook 'zookeeper', path: '/Users/kuhlmant/src/mon/cookbooks/zookeeper'
```
- Edit your local cookbook as needed
- Run `berks update <cookbook_name>`
- If the Vagrant VM is already up, run `vagrant provision`.  Otherwise, run `vagrant up`
- When finish testing commit and upload your cookbook as normal but don't forget to bump the cookbook version in the metadata.rb.

## Running behind a Web Proxy
If you are behind a proxy you can install the `vagrant-proxyconf` pluging to have Vagrant honor standard proxy-related environment variables and set the
VM to use them also.
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf
```

# Vertica
Vertica is supported instead of influxdb, this is especially useful for large deployments.

Before using Vertica must be downloaded from the [Vertica site](https://my.vertica.com/). Download these packages and place in the root of this repository.

- `vertica_7.0.1-0_amd64.deb`
- `vertica-r-lang_7.0.1-0_amd64.deb`

The `vertica::console` recipe is not enabled by default, but if it is added, this package is also needed.

- `vertica-console_7.0.1-0_amd64.deb`

After the vertica packages are installed the configuration must be changed to run Vertica. Specifically besides starting Vertica the data bags
for the monasca_api and the monasca_persister need to be updated so these services use Vertica rather than InfluxDB.

The alternative split setup is configured for running Vertica.

# Alternate Vagrant Configurations
To run any of these alternate configs, simply run the Vagrant commands from within the subdir.  Note that the Vertica debs must be _copied_
(not symlinked) into the subdir as well. See the README.md in the subdir for more details.

- `split` subdir - The various monitoring components split into their own VMs. The split setup runs Vertica by default rather than influxdb.
- `ds-build` subdir - This is used for building a new devstack server image.  It does not typically need to be run.

In the past other alternative setups were working including running mini-mon in HP Public Cloud and scripts for putting it on baremetal. These are no
longer supported.
